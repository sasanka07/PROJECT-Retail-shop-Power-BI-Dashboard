Certainly! Let me share with you the exciting project I recently completed as a freelance data scientist. üìäüîç

Project Title: ‚ÄúGlobal Sales Insights Dashboard‚Äù

Introduction: As a data scientist, I was tasked with creating an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into global sales trends. The goal was to empower business stakeholders with actionable information to enhance decision-making. Let me walk you through how I designed and implemented this project.

Page 1: Sales Trends and Top Performers


Sales Trend Analysis:

On the first page, I focused on visualizing the overall sales trend over time. I used line charts to display monthly or quarterly sales fluctuations. This allowed stakeholders to quickly identify growth patterns, seasonality, and any anomalies.
Top 10 Customers:

To recognize our most valuable customers who contributing high in sales of retail shop.
The columns displayed customer names, total sales, and perhaps additional information like their total quantity bought or region.
Top 10 Countries by Sales:

Another critical aspect was understanding which countries contributed the most to our revenue. I designed a bar chart highlighting the top 10 countries based on sales and total quantity sold and Sales.
Excluded, United kingdom, because it act as outlier and client also agree to remove it. 
Color-coded bars made it easy to compare performance across different regions
Page 2: Geographic Insights with Bubble Map

Geographic Distribution:

On the second page, I shifted focus to geographical insights. I created a world map using built-in map visuals.
Each country was represented by a bubble, sized proportionally to its total sales. The larger the bubble, the higher the revenue generated from that country.
Hovering over a bubble revealed additional details, such as the country name and exact sales amount and total quantity sold
Interactivity and Filters:

The map responded dynamically, adjusting bubble sizes and colors based on the selected filters.
Conclusion: The ‚ÄúGlobal online Retail Sales Insights Dashboard‚Äù provided a holistic view of sales landscape. Stakeholders could explore trends, identify key customers, and pinpoint growth areas across the globe. As a freelancer, I took pride in delivering a powerful tool that empowered data-driven decisions. üåêüíº
